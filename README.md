eRestaurant

Simple restaurant browsing app that I came up with and coded for to complete the CodersLab course.

The application has many functionalities:

    Restaurant list and Menu list for not logged users,
    User panel with the ability to add restaurants, their tables, their menu and dishes to the menu (User must be validated as Owner by Admin. Admin must also additionally authorize the restaurant before it will be visible on the list),
    Regular users can send messages and reserve tables for up to 4 people and up to 2 hours.

Application is written in Python, Django and a little JS. Additionally some simple CSS has been added.
